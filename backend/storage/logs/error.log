scanned 0 barcode symbols from 1 images

WARNING: barcode data was not detected in some image(s)
  things to check:
    - is the barcode type supported?  currently supported symbologies are:
      EAN/UPC (EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E, ISBN-10, ISBN-13),
      Code 128, Code 39 and Interleaved 2 of 5
    - is the barcode large enough in the image?
    - is the barcode mostly in focus?
    - is there sufficient contrast/illumination?
