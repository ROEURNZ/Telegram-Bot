# Proposal for PHP Telegram Bot

## Commands and Button Processes

### 1. Start Button
- **Process for Starting the Bot:**
  - Users must click the **"Start"** button to initiate interaction with the bot.
  - Users cannot skip the start process; if they do not click "Start," they will be restricted from accessing subsequent steps.

### 2. Language Selection
- **Process for Language Selection:**
  - Users can choose their preferred language through the buttons **"US English"** and **"KH ភាសាខ្មែរ"**.
  - This step is only accessible after the user has clicked the **"Start"** button in the previous step.
  - The same restriction applies: users must complete the previous step to proceed.

### 3. Share Contact
- **Process for Sharing Contact:**
  - This step follows the language selection and maintains the restriction from previous steps.
  - Users can share their contact information using the **"Share Contact"** button (with dynamic labeling based on the selected language) or by using the command **/share_contact**.
  - Clicking **/share_contact** sends the user's contact directly to the Telegram bot.

### 4. Upload Barcode or QR Code Images
- **Process for Uploading Images:**
  - Users can upload one or more images of barcodes or QR codes (uploading QR codes is optional).
  - Access to this step is contingent upon successfully completing previous steps; restrictions apply.
  - When users reach this step, the bot will send the message:
    - **upload_prompt**: "Please upload images containing barcodes or QR codes."
  - While images are being uploaded, the bot will send:
    - **decode_prompt**: "Please wait for a few seconds; the bot is processing the images."
  - Users can either use the **/decode** command or click the **"Decoding"** button to initiate decoding.
  - Decoded results will be sent to the Telegram bot immediately after processing.

### 5. Share Current Location
- **Process for Sharing Location:**
  - This step also follows the previous steps and will not be accessible if any prior step has failed.
  - Users can share their current location using either the **/sharelocation** command or the **"Share Location"** button, which will retrieve and send their location directly.

## Additional Features and Functions

### Commands
- **/stop**: Forcefully ends the ongoing processes.
- **/help**: Provides assistance and information about available commands.
- **/restart**: Restarts the bot from the initial step, allowing users to begin the interaction anew.
